    This thin wrapper starts a ZMQ communication bridge as stand-alone process.
    It expects two arguments:

      - name: name of the communication bridge to start
      - cfgf: path to a config file to use

    It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that `$name` is unique.

    The given  config file in `$cfgf` is read, and searched for a subsection
    `bridges.$name`.  That config will be extracted and written to `$name.cfgf`,
    which is then used by the bridge.  If `$name` is not found in the `bridges`
    subsection, an error will be raised.  If no `bridges` subsection is found,
    the config is considered to be self-sufficient, and will be used as is.

    The bridge's stdout and stderr will be written to `$name.out` and
    `$name.err`, respectively, log messages will appear in `$name.log`.
    After startup, it will write the bridge's communication endpoint URLs
    to the file `$name.url`, in the form:

        SUB: $addr_in
        PUB: $addr_out

    The `SUB` address is to be used for subscribers, the `PUB` address for
    publishers -- but the respective RP classes will dig the correct addresses
    from that file.

    A typical pubsub test scenario would be:

        > radical-pilot-bridge command.cfg                [1]
        > radical-pilot-sub    command foo bar            [2]
        > radical-pilot-pub    command foo_1 foo_2 bar_1  [3]
        > radical-pilot-sub    command bar baz pop        [4]
        > radical-pilot-pub    command bar_2 baz_1 buz_1  [5]

    [1] establishes the pubsub channel 'command'
    [2] and [4] connect to the command channel, subscribe for certain topics
    [3] and [5] connect to the command channel, send messages for some topics

    Note that the `buz_1` messages will never be received [5], and that the
    `pop` subscriber [4] will get no messages for that topic.
