  + fix invokation frequency of idle callbacks
  + clean pilot cancelation
  + client agent startup
  + exec worker/watcher concurrency
  + lrms/scheduler dependency
  + profile names
  + log file name uniquenenss
  + state history (update ordering)
    + multiple updater instances will compete for state updates and push them
      out of order, thus screwing with the CU states which end up in the DB.\
    + limit to one update instance
  + pilot updates via updater (different pubsub channel)
  + make sure finalize is called on terminate (via atexit?)
  + make sure all profile entries exist, merge from module profiling branch
  + merge from devel
  + merge from osgng
  + forward tunnel endpoint from bootstrap_1 to agent
  + make sure opaque_slot is a dict
  + make sure that the lrms_config_hook is called only once
    (this is implicit now, as we only have one scheduler instance, and thus
    only one (set of) LRMS instances)
  - At this point it might be simpler to have one LRMS instance which handles
    MPI and non-MPI?  Not sure about the diversity of combinations which need
    supporting...
  = component failures need to propagate to the agent to trigger shutdown
  = torus scheduler is broken in the split arch
  - advance() implicitly publishes unit state, but the publisher needs to be
    declared explicitly.
  + rename 'worker' to 'sub-agent' to avoid confusion?
  - executor should write CU script in one go, not incrementally
  - component: collapse declare_input and declare_worker
  + cu['_id'] -> cu['uid'] etc

  + state pubsub now has [cmd, ttype, thing] tuples fed from advance.
  + self.advance(cu, FAILED, ...) will not find a suitable output channel.
    Handle gracefully!  
  + Always push final things fully to DB!
  - we mostly don't need create() methods -- in many cases we can just use
    constructors.
  + default output staging component: __init__ calls Component __init__, but
    should call base __init__, which then calls Component __init__
    Same holds for other component implementations.
  - component's base.create calls should pick up all component implementations
    automatically, instead of having a static type map
  + Bridges should be created by session, both on client and on agent side.
  + on the component, add 'declare_thread' for actions which are needed more
    frequent than idle callbacks, and also need some guarantees on the
    frequency.  Prominent example: execution watcher threads.  Handle the
    'work()' loop as just one of those threads (the default one).
  + register_idle_callback -> register_timed_callback
  + component watcher needs to clean out component threads even for failed
    components
  + shutdown command propagation is broken

  + unit cancelation is best done on component level
    + subscribe to control to get cancel requests
    + for each cancel request
      + add to self._cancel_requested
    + whenver we see an advance or work request:
      + if uid in self._cancel_requested: advance(CANCEL) + drop   
    - we can still additionally add cancel actions during staging and
      execution -- but the component base should provide support for that.

  - use heartbeat mechanism also for bridges, agents, sub_agents
  + define _cfg['heart'] and use that for heartbeat src instead of owner,
    limiting traffic and noise
  - component.stop() should *first* unregister component_checker_cb 
    (and probably all other callbacks)
    - in fact, we should be very careful to unregister callbacks in reverse
      order of registration.
  - pilot default error cb calls sys.exit -> no shutdown.

  + update the backfilling scheduler
  - state notifications should be obtained via a tailed cursor
  - update worker could check if a unit has multiple state updates pending. If
    so, only send the last one.  The client side cann still play callbacks for
    all intermediate states.  That implies delayed filling of the bulk.
  + update worker should not push state_hist on state updates, only on full
    udpdates.
  - pilot failing during wait_units results in timeout.

  + the update worker should have a list of keys which it needs to push to
    MongoDB, and it should ignore other dict entries.  Alternatively, components
    should use underscore-prefixed keys for things which don't need to be stored
    in MongoDB.

  + separate single-process components from multi-processed, in terms of
    initialization
  + make sure we don't carry locks across fork calls.  If that turns out to be
    difficult (hi logging), we have to execve after fork and start afresh.
  - idle_cb -> timed_cb (we make no promise on idleness, really)
  - kill pilots on pmgr.launching.finalize_child?
  + saga_pid in pmgr.launcher control_cb
  + heartbeat interval assertion
  - dying agent bridge causes agent shutdown to hang
  - lrms -> rm
  + dying pilot watcher cb remains undetected
  - separation of controller.[uid,heart,owner] is unclean

  - cancellation leads to double wait, which is ok, but also reports twice,
    which is not
  - umgr wait and pmgr wait report different things, differently
    (inclusion of previously final things, final state marker)

  + ctrl 
    + things -> watchable
  - advance -> remove push/pull args, and make those separate calls?  
    Probably not though...
  + comment in cb in sch base
  + remove release_slot in rr
  + add_pilot -> add_pilots
  + start/stop in mgrs...

  + open saga ticket: condor staging target should point to the job cwd, not
    to intermediate storage
  - units can end up in 'CANCELED + agent_pending', so agent pulls unusable
    units.  Final states should *always* set 'control' to 'umgr' or 'pmgr',
    respectively

  + worker/agent.py -> agent/agent_n.py
  + agent_n controller has uid of pilot.000.ctrl -- should be agent_n.ctrl
  + sub-agents: catch stdout/err for popen procs
  - agent_n does not need a child process really?

  + agent state ACTIVE is recorded twice
  + agent state DONE   is recorded twice on timeout

  + we should never have a wildcard `except`, as that will also catch inetrrupts
    and system exits, which we though expect to fall through to the component
    layer for lifetime management.


Expected Termination Behavior:
==============================

application calls session close
-------------------------------

  - session.close() at any point in time
    - in main thread:
      - close all umgrs
        - terminate all threads
        - cancel any non-final units and wait for them
          - advance them to CANCELED
          - issue 'cancel' commands (no reschedule)
          ? do we want notifications for the unit cancel?
          ? do we rely on UpdateWorker to register/store CANCELED advance?
        - stop all components (delegated to session controller)
        - stop all bridges    (delegated to session controller)
      - close all pmgrs
        - cancel any non-final pilots and wait for them
        ? do we want notifications for the pilot cancel?
        - terminate all threads
        - stop all components (delegated to session controller)
        - stop all bridges    (delegated to session controller)
      - terminate all threads
      - close session controller
        - terminate all threads
        - stop all bridges
        - stop all components
    - in other threads
      - as in main thread
      - thread should then exit (default), call sys.exit, or raise.
    - in other processes / components
      - stop the component
      - no message is sent, we expect the pmgr, umgr or session watcher to
        detect the closed component (if needed), and to start teardown 
        -> watcher calling session.close + raise

        
user interrupts via Ctrl-C
--------------------------
  - application must except, call session.close()


pilot fails, exit_on_error is set
---------------------------------
  - call to sys.exit()
  - application must except, call session.close()


pilot times out
---------------
  - the agent_0 starts an idle callback (agent_command_cb) which checks runtime
  - if runtime limit is reached
    - set self._final_cause to 'timeout'
    - call self.stop()
    - agent_0 is a worker w/o child.  stop() triggers this sequence:
      - call finalize_parent
        - stop self._lrms
        - update db for final state
        - call session.close()

      - call finalize_common
        - terminate and join all subscribers
        - close profiler


tmp:
----
  - pilots canceled but state is not picked up during shutdown
  - always get DEFAULT_DBURL from session config (use a  class method on session)
