# JSRUN test suite

## Requirements

* Every individual test needs to be placed in ```test_*``` folder;
* three files are required under the ```test_*``` folder:
  * ```cmds```:
    * line 1: short description about test;
    * line 2: any pre_exec cmds;
    * line 3: jsrun cmd to execute;
  * ```res_set```: Resource set file for the test;
  * ```exp_out```: expected output;

## Assertion

The expected output has the following structure:

```
MPI Ranks = 1
OpenMP Threads = 1
GPUs per Resource Set = 0
Unique_Nodes = 1
<key> = <expected value>
```

The assert function in jobs.sh extracts a specific string for every 'key' in the
expected output file. An 'actual value' is further extracted from this string.
The 'actual value' is compared with the 'expected value' in the expected output
file.

Currently, we have 4 keys. These can be extended to include more by adding the
keys to the expected output file and adding the corresponding extraction/output
parser code to the assert function in jobs.sh.

## Execution

To manually execute all the tests, clone the ```test_jsrun``` folder on Summit
and run ```bsub jobs.sh```. All the tests are performed daily via ```at``` on
Summit. See inline comments for details.

### Note

* Base directory is ```/ccs/home/vivekb/test_jsrun```;
* results are located in a folder named with the current date;
* a summary is sent to the email address specified in ```jobs.sh```.

## Misc

* The ```at``` process needs to be reinvoked after system maintenenace.
