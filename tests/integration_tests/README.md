# Integration testing with resources

Integration testing on resources requires periodic jobs. To achieve this, batch
scripts are offered under the `batch_scripts` folder. Currently, there is a
script for SDSC Comet.

The script defines the following to execute the test:

- A `TEST` environment variable that contains the path to the test files to be
  executed. All test paths should be included and be space-separated.
-
    Example:
    ```
    TEST="radical.pilot/tests/integration_tests/test_resources/test_rm/test_slurm.py"
    ```

- Moves to the assigned folder for testing, which is the same as submitting the
  script, removes any prior copy of RP's repo, the previous virtual environment
  variable, and clones the `devel` branch only.

- Loads the necessary modules, creates and activates a virtual environment.
  Those lines should be updated for every resource. After the virtual
  environment's activation, the script installs RP and runs the tests. If one
  or more or those tests fail, the script runs a utility python file that
  creates an RP repository issue. This python file takes as arguments the name
  of the resource and the log filename. Update the resource name accordingly.

- Send a singal to Github with the state of the test via a `curl` command. For example:
```bash
   curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
    -H "Authorization: token $GIT_TOKEN" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"event_type": "test_<resource>", "client_payload": { "text": "<state>"}}' \
    https://api.github.com/repos/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/dispatches
```
Please see existing batch scripts for the data specifics.

- Finally, the script submits another job to the queue.

## Setup
Tests require that a Github token is set up and included in the `.bashrc` of the 
account that runs the tests. On Summit instead of adding an environment variable, 
change the `GIT_TOKEN` entry with your actual token.

Example:
```
export GIT_TOKEN=soimethignsomething
```

## Create a Github workflow

The last part is to create a Github workflow that provides information about the 
state of the integration tests. This Github workflow file lives under 
`.github/workflows`.

The template of such a file is:
```yaml
name: Resource Integration Test

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [ test_<resource> ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 */1 *'

jobs:
  inter_jobs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check event
      if: github.event.client_payload.text
      run: |
        echo "Event text: ${{ github.event.client_payload.text }}"
        if [ ${{ github.event.client_payload.text }} == "success" ]
        then
            echo "Success"
        else
            echo "Failure"
            false
        fi
  periodic_jobs:
    if: github.event.client_payload.text == null
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.6
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.6.13
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install requests
    - name: Cron
      run: |
        tests/bin/radical-pilot-test-verify -y '<filename>' -d 7

```

This file receives a signal from outside, checks the payload and succeeds or 
fails based on the payload. Also, it defines a monthly cron job that checks if 
it received a signal the last week. If not, it fails the test for the specific 
resource.

## Add a badge

It is necessary to add a badge in the main README file of RP for a resource 
where integration tests are running. The badge looks like:
```
[![Resource Integration Tests](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/actions/workflows/<filename>.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/actions/workflows/<filename>.yml)
```
