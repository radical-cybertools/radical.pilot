MPI tasks
*******************

So far we have run single-core tasks in a number of configurations. This
example introduces two new concepts: running multi-core MPI tasks and
specifying input data for the task, in this case a simple python MPI script.

------------
Preparation
------------

Download the file ``mpi_tasks.py`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/master/examples/docs/mpi_tasks.py

If you have a local MPI installation, the example may work right out of the
box on your local machine. However, if you want to try it out with different
resources, like remote HPC clusters, open the file ``mpi_tasks.py`` with your
favorite editor and look for the sections marked:

.. code-block:: python

        # ----- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS ------

Change the code below that line, according to the instructions in the
comments.

This example makes use of an application that we first download to our own
environment and then have staged as input to the MPI tasks.

Download the file ``helloworld_mpi.py`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/master/examples/helloworld_mpi.py


----------
Execution
----------

** This assumes you have installed RADICAL-Pilot in a Python virtualenv. You also need access to a MongoDB server.**

Set the `RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL` environment variable in your shell to the
MongoDB server you want to use, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

        export RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL=mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<hostname>:<port>/

If RADICAL-Pilot is installed and the MongoDB URL is set, you should be good
to run your program:

.. code-block:: bash

    python mpi_tasks.py

The output should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    Initializing Pilot Manager ...
    Submitting Pilot to Pilot Manager ...
    Initializing Task Manager ...
    Registering Pilot with Task Manager ...
    Submit Tasks to Task Manager ...
    Waiting for CUs to complete ...
    ...
    Waiting for CUs to complete ...
    All CUs completed successfully!
    Closed session, exiting now ...


----------------------
Logging and Debugging
----------------------

Since working with distributed systems is inherently complex and much of the
complexity is hidden within RADICAL-Pilot, it is necessary to do a lot of
internal logging. By default, logging output is disabled, but if something
goes wrong or if you're just curious, you can enable the logging output by
setting the environment variable ``RADICAL_PILOT_LOG_LVL`` to a value between
CRITICAL (print only critical messages) and DEBUG (print all messages).

Give it a try with the above example:

.. code-block:: bash

  RADICAL_PILOT_LOG_LVL=DEBUG python simple_bot.py
