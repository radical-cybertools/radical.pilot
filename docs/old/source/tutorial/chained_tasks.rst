Chained Tasks
*************

What if you had two different executables -- A and B, to run? What if this second set of
executables (B) had some dependencies on data from the first set (A)? Can you use one RADICAL-Pilot
to run both set jobs? Yes!

The example below submits a set of echo jobs (set A) using RADICAL-Pilot, and
for every successful job (with state ``DONE``), it submits another job (set B)
to the same Pilot-Job.

We can think of  A is being comprised of subjobs {a1,a2,a3}, while B is
comprised of subjobs {b1,b2,b3}. Rather than wait for each subjob {a1},{a2},{a3}
to complete, {b1} can run as soon as {a1} is complete, or {b1} can run as soon
as a slot becomes available â€“ i.e. {a2} could finish before {a1}.

The code below demonstrates this behavior. As soon as there is a slot available
to run a job in B (i.e. a job in A has completed), it executes the job in B.
This keeps the RADICAL-Pilot throughput high.

Preparation
------------

Download the file ``chained_tasks.py`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/master/examples/docs/chained_tasks.py

Open the file ``chained_tasks.py`` with your favorite editor. The example should 
work right out of the box on your local machine. However, if you want to try it
out with different resources, like remote HPC clusters, look for the sections 
marked: 

.. code-block:: python

        # ----- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS ------

and change the code below accordging to the instructions in the comments.

.. You will need to make the necessary changes to ``chained_tasks.py`` as you
.. did in the previous example. 

.. The important difference between this file and the previous file is that there
.. are two separate "USER DEFINED TASK DESCRIPTION" sections - numbered 1 and 2.
.. Again, these two sections will not require any modifications for the purposes of
.. this tutorial. We will not review every variable again, but instead, review the
.. relationship between the 2 Task descriptions.

.. Go to line 104, "BEGIN USER DEFINED TASK DESCRIPTION." This looks a lot like the
.. description we saw in the previous example. It is also contained in a for loop
.. from 0 to the NUMBER_JOBS. We are running the same executable, with almost the
.. same arguments, except that we append an 'A' as an additional TASK_SET variable.
.. If we look at line 129ff, we see that as soon as a Task in the "A" set reaches the
.. "Done" state, we start what is defined in "BEGIN USER DEFINED TASK B DESCRIPTION"
.. as a "B" Task. This shows us an important feature of RADICAL-Pilot.  We can call
.. get_state() on a Task to find out if it is complete or not. The second task
.. description is to run the same executable, /bin/echo, and print instead that it
.. is a B Task, with its task number.


----------
Execution
----------

**This assumes you have installed RADICAL-Pilot either globally or in a 
Python virtualenv. You also need access to a MongoDB server.**

Set the `RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL` environment variable in your shell to the 
MongoDB server you want to use, for example:

.. code-block:: bash
        
        export RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL=mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<mongodb_server>:27017/

If RADICAL-Pilot is installed and the MongoDB URL is set, you should be good
to run your program: 

.. code-block:: bash

    python chained_tasks.py
