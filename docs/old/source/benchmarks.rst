Benchmarks
**********

Performance, and specifically improved application performance, is a main
objective for the existence of RADICAL-Pilot.  To enable users to understand
performance of both RADICAL-Pilot itself and of the applications executed with
RADICAL-Pilot, we provide some utilities for benchmarking and performance
analysis.

.. note::

   Performance profiling is enabled by setting `RADICAL_PILOT_PROFILE` in the
   application environment.  If profiling is enabled, the application can
   request any number of cores on the resource `local.localhost`.

During operation, RADICAL-Pilot stores time stamps of different events and
activities in MongoDB, under the ID of the `radical.pilot.Session`.  That
information can be used for post mortem performance analysis.  To do so, one
needs to specify the session ID to be examined -- you can print the session ID
when running your application, via

.. code-block:: python
   
   print "session id: %s" % session.uid

With that session ID, you can use the tool `radicalpilot-stats` to print some
statistics, and to plot some performance graphs:

  
.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ radicalpilot-stats -m plot -s 53b5bbd174df926f4a4d3318

This command will, in the `plot` mode shown above, produce
a `53b5bbd174df926f4a4d3318.png` and a  `53b5bbd174df926f4a4d3318.pdf` plot
(where `53b5bbd174df926f4a4d3318` is the session ID as mentioned.  The same
command has other modi for inspecting sessions -- you can see a help message via

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ./bin/radicalpilot-stats -m help

   usage   : ./bin/radicalpilot-stats -m mode [-d dburl] [-s session]
   example : ./bin/radicalpilot-stats -m stats -d mongodb://localhost/radicalpilot -s 536afe101d41c83696ea0135

   modes :

      help  : show this message
      list  : show  a  list   of sessions in the database
      tree  : show  a  tree   of session objects
      dump  : show  a  tree   of session objects, with full details
      sort  : show  a  list   of session objects, sorted by type
      hist  : show timeline   of session history
      stat  : show statistics of session history (not implemented)
      plot  : save gnuplot representing session history

    The default command is 'list'.  If no session ID is specified, operations
    which apply to a single session will choose the last session in the given
    DB.  The default MongoDB is 'mongodb://ec2-184-72-89-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com:27017/radicalpilot/'
      
An exemplar performance plot is included below.  It represents a number of
events and metrics, represented over a time axis.  In particular, it shows (at
the bottom) the utilization of the various compute cores managed by the pilots
in the session -- if that utilization is showing no major gaps, your
application should make efficient use of the allocated resources.

Note that the plotting capability needs an up-to-date installation of gnuplot
with the cairo-png backend.  For Linux, that can be installed from the usual
package repositories.  For MacOS, the following should take care of the
installation:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Install and configure brew: http://brew.sh/
   # Install xquartz. Download the dmg package from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
   # From a terminal issue the following commands:
      
   $ brew install cairo
   $ brew install -v gnuplot --pdf --cairo --latex --with-x --wx
