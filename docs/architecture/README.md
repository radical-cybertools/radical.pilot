### RP architecture snippets

Documentation, discussions and code snippets contained in this directory
are likely not useful to RP's users.  They mostly represent design studies and
prototype implementations of certain aspects of RP's architecture.  We keep that
information here for historic reasons. More up to date and digestible
infrmation on these topics are now located on the project's [github
discussions](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/discussions).
