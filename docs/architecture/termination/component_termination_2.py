# RP makes heavy use of processes and threads.  Communication is normally
# established via ZMQ channels -- but specifically in the case of abnormal
# conditions, an orderly termination sequence must be controled via exceptions
# and signals.
#
# Alas, a number of core python errors makes this difficult to achieve.  Amongst
# them are:
#
#   - http://bugs.python.org/issue24862
#     processes can only be waited for by the parent process, which makes it
#     difficult to control process termination in a process tree if the process
#     chain gets interrupted, aven if the leaf PIDs are known.
#
#   - http://bugs.python.org/issue23395
#     `SIGINT` signal handlers conflict with the *only* documented inter-thread
#     termination procedure `thread.interrupt_main()`.  This requires us to
#     either not handle `SIGINT`, or to find an alternative approach to thread
#     termination handling.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue21895
#     several methods in python are not signal-interruptible, including
#     thread.join() and socket.select().  The reason is that those calls map to
#     libc level calls, but the CPython C-level signal handler is *not* directly
#     invoking the Python level signal handlers, but only sets a flag for later
#     handling.  That handling is supposed to happen at bytecode boundaries, ie.
#     after the any libc-call returns.
#
#     That could be circumvented by always using libc call equivalents with
#     a timeout.  Alas, that is not always possible -- for example, join() does
#     not have a timeout parameter.
#
#   - http://bugs.python.org/issue1856
#     sys.exit can segfault Python if daemon threads are active.  This is fixed 
#     in python3, but will not be backported to 2.x, because...
#
#   - http://bugs.python.org/issue21963
#     ... it would hang up for daemon threads which don't ever re-acquire the
#     GIL.  That is not an issue for us - but alas, no backport thus.  So, we
#     need to make sure our watcher threads (which are daemons) terminate 
#     on their own.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue27889
#     signals can not reliably be translated into exceptions, as the delayed
#     signal handling implies races on the exception handling.  A nested
#     exception loop seems to avoid that problem -- but that cannot be enforced
#     in application code or 3rd party modules (and is very cumbersome to
#     consistently apply throughout the code stack).
#
#
# Not errors, but expected behavior which makes life difficult:
#
#   - https://joeshaw.org/python-daemon-threads-considered-harmful/
#     Python's daemon threads can still be alive while the interpreter shuts
#     down.  The shutdown will remove all loaded modules -- which will lead to
#     the dreaded 
#       'AttributeError during shutdown -- can likely be ignored'
#     exceptions.  There seems no clean solution for that, but we can try to
#     catch & discard the exception in the watchers main loop (which possibly
#     masks real errors though).
#
#   - cpython's delayed signal handling can lead to signals being ignored when
#     they are translated into exceptions.
#     Assume this pseudo-code loop in a low-level 3rd party module:
# 
#     data = None
#     while not data:
#         try:
#             if fd.select(timeout):
#                 data = read(size)
#         except:
#             # select timed out - retry
#             pass
#
#     Due to the verly generous except clauses, a signal interrupting the select
#     would be interpreted as select timeout.  Those clauses *do* exist in
#     modules and core libs.
#     (This race is different from https://bugs.python.org/issue27889)
#
#   - a cpython-level API call exists to inject exceptions into other threads:
#
#       import ctypes
#       ctypes.pythonapi.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc(ctypes.c_long(thread_id),
#                                                  ctypes.py_object(e))
#
#     Alas, almost the same problems apply as for signal handling: exceptions
#     thus inserted are interpreted delayed, and are thus prone to the same
#     races as signal handlers.  Further, they can easily get lost in
#     too-generous except clauses in low level modules and core libraries.
#     Further, unlike signals, they will not interrupt any libc calls.
#     That method is thus inferior to signal handling.
#
#   - mp.join() can miss starting child processes:
#     When start() is called, join can be called immediately after.  At that
#     point, the child may, however, not yet be alive, and join would *silently*
#     return immediately.  If between that failed join and process termination
#     the child process *actually* comes up, the process termination will hang,
#     as the child has not been waited upon.
#
#   - we actually can't really use fork() either, unless it is *immediately* (as
#     in *first call*) followed by an exec, because core python modules don't
#     free locks on fork.  We monkeypatch the logging module though and also
#     ensure unlock at-fork for our own stack, but the problem remains (zmq
#     comes to mind).
#     This problem could be addressed - but this is useless unless the other
#     problems are addressed, too (the problem applies to process-bootstrapping
#     only, and is quite easy to distinguish from other bugs / races).
#
#
# Bottom line:
#
#   - we can't use
#     - signal handlers which raise exceptions
#     - exception injects into other threads
#     - thread.interrupt_main() in combination with SIGINT(CTRL-C)
#     - daemon threads
#     - multiprocessing with a method target
#
#
# NOTE: The code below does *not* demonstrate a workaround for all issues, just
#       for some of them.  At this point, I am not aware of a clean (ie.
#       reliable) approach to thread and process termination with cpython.
#       I leave the code below as-is though, for the time being, to remind 
#       myself of better times, when there was hope... :P
#
# NOTE: For some GIL details, see http://www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf
#       This focuses on performance, but contains some details relevant to
#       signal handling.  Note this is from 2009, mentions that  GIL management
#       has not changed for the past 10 years.  It has not changed by now
#       either, FWIW.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This code demonstrates a workaround for those issues, and serves as a test for
# the general problem space.
#
#   - main() creates 3 processes
#   - each of the processes creates 3 threads: 2 workers and a watcher 
#     (watching the worker)
#   - main() additionally creates a thread which watches process 2
#
# The resulting hierarchy is:
#
#   - main:      1: process 0, MainThread
#                2: process 0, ProcessWatcherThread
#     - child 1: 3: process 1, MainThread
#                4: process 1, WorkerThread
#                -: process 1, WorkerThread
#                6: process 1, ThreadWatcherThread
#     - child 2: -: process 2, MainThread
#                -: process 2, WorkerThread
#                -: process 2, WorkerThread
#                -: process 2, ThreadWatcherThread
#     - child 3: -: process 3, MainThread
#                -: process 3, WorkerThread
#                -: process 3, WorkerThread
#                -: process 3, ThreadWatcherThread
#
# We create 6 test cases, for each of the resulting entities, where for each
# case the respective entity will raise a RuntimeError.  The expected result is
# that the Exception is caught, and shutdown progresses up the hierarchy,
# leading to a clean shutdown of main, with no left over prcesses or threads,
# and which each process/thread logging its clean termination.
#
# The used approach is as follows:
#
#  - any entity which creates other entities must watch those, by pulling state 
#    of the child entities, in a separate watcher thread.
#  - that separate watcher thread will inform the parent via
#    `ru.cancel_main_thread()` about failing children, which will raise
#    a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception in the main thread.
#  - that exception must be caught, leading to termination of the parent
#    component
#  - the watcher thread must not be waited upon, and thus will be a daemonized
#    thread.  The watcher will thus also watch the main thread:
#        for i in mt.enumerate():
#            if i.name == "MainThread":
#                if not i.is_alive():
#                    self._log.info('main thread gone - terminate')
#                    sys.exit(-1)
#    The watcher will further shut down when
#      - self._term is set
#      - it has nothing to watch anymore
#    The latter is somewhat cumbersome to handle, as the component needs to keep
#    track of the number of watchables and needs to possibly restart the watcher,
#    but whatever.
#  - all termination is downstream and process-local.  In other words,
#    any component which encounters an error will 
#    - terminate its child threads   (if any), excluding the watcher thread
#    - terminate its child processes (if any), by sending a `TERM` signal (15)
#    - terminate itself, by calling `sys.exit(1)`
#    - *not* attempt to otherwise communicate its termination to the entity
#      which created it.
#
#  - SIGCHILD *can not* be used to signal child process termination, because of 
#    the Python bugs listed above.
#  - signals *can not* be used in general to actively communicate error 
#    conditions to parents, for the same reaons.
#  - SIGTERM is used to communicate termination to *child* processes -- python
#    promises to *eventually* invoke signal handlers in the child's main thread.
#    Thus terminated children must be waited for, to avoid zombies.  A wait
#    timeout and subsequend `SIGKILL` (9) is appropriate.
#  - daemon threads *can not* be expected to die on sys.exit()
