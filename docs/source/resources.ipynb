    "**RADICAL-Pilot** allows you to launch a pilot allocating a large number of cores on a local and remote HPC cluster. The pilot represent a resource holder which is used to run multiple tasks, each with a defined number of cores. This separates resource allocation and management from resource usage, and avoids HPC cluster queue policies and waiting times which can significantly reduce the total time to completion of your application."
