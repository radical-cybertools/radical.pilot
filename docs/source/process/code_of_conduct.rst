Code of Conduct
===============

This code of conduct regulates the activities of the maintainers and
contributors to the RADICAL-Pilot (RP) project.

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, sexual identity and orientation, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, or religion.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language;
* being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
* gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
* focusing on what is best for the community as opposed to personal agendas and
  preferences;
* showing empathy and exercising emotional responsibility towards other
  community members;

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances;
* public or private harassment;
* publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission;
* other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting, as defined by the `ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
  Conduct <https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics>`__.

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event, or publishing material related to
the project. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by
project maintainers.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project's Principal Investigators (PIs) at
shantenu.jha@rutgers.edu and matteo.turilli@rutgers.edu. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The PIs are obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
