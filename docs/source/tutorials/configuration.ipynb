    "# Configuration System\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot (RP) uses a configuration system to set control and management parameters for the initialization of its components and to define resource entry points for the target platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Run description](#Run-description)\n",
    "  * Resource label for a target platform configuration file;\n",
    "  * Project allocation name (i.e., account/project, _specific for HPC platforms_);\n",
    "  * Job queue name (i.e., queue/partition, _specific for HPC platforms_);\n",
    "  * Amount of the resources (e.g., `cores`, `gpus`, `memory`) to allocate for the runtime period;\n",
    "  * Mode to access the target platform (e.g., `local`, `ssh`, `batch/interactive`).\n",
    "* [Target platform description](#Platform-description)\n",
    "  * Batch system (e.g., `SLURM`, `LSF`, etc.);\n",
    "  * Provided launch methods (e.g., `SRUN`, `MPIRUN`, etc.);\n",
    "  * Environment setup (including package manager, working directory, etc.);\n",
    "  * Entry points: batch system URL, file system URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run description\n",
    "\n",
    "Users have to describe at least one pilot in each RP application. That is done by instantiating a [radical.pilot.PilotDescription](../apidoc.rst#PilotDescription) object. Among that object's attributes, `resource` is mandatory and is referred as a resource label (or platform ID), which corresponds to a target platform configuration file (see the section [Platform description](#Platform-description)). Users need to know what ID corresponds to the HPC platform on which they want to execute their RP application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Allocation parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Every run should state the project name (i.e., allocation account), preferable queue for a job submission, and the amount of required resources explicitly, unless it is a local run without accessing any batch system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import radical.pilot as rp\n",

    "    'gpus'    : 8,                # amount of GPU slots\n",
    "    'runtime' : 15                # maximum runtime for a pilot (in minutes)\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource access schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource access schema (`pd.access_schema`) is provided as part of a platform description, and in case of more than one access schemas users can set a specific one in [radical.pilot.PilotDescription](../apidoc.rst#PilotDescription). Check schema availability per target platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `local`: launch RP application from the target platform (e.g., login nodes of the specific machine).\n",
    "* `ssh`: launch RP application outside the target platform and use `ssh` protocol and corresponding SSH client to access the platform remotely.\n",
    "* `gsissh`: launch RP application outside the target platform and use GSI-enabled SSH to access the platform remotely.\n",
    "* `interactive`: launch RP application from the target platform within the interactive session after being placed on allocated resources (e.g., batch or compute nodes).\n",
    "* `batch`: launch RP application by a submitted batch script at the target platform.\n",

    "## Platform description\n",
    "\n",
    "The RADICAL-Pilot uses configuration files for bookkeeping of supported platforms. Each configuration file identifies a facility (e.g., ACCESS, TACC, ORNL, ANL, etc.), is written in JSON and is named following the `resource_<facility_name>.json` convention. Each facility configuration file contains a set of platform names/labels with corresponding configuration parameters. Resource label (or platform ID) follows the `<facility_name>.<platform_name>` convention, and users use it for the `resource` attribute of their [radical.pilot.PilotDescription](../apidoc.rst#PilotDescription) object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predefined configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "The RADICAL-Pilot development team maintains a growing set of pre-defined configuration files for supported HPC platforms (list platform descriptions in RP's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/tree/master/src/radical/pilot/configs)).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if users want to execute their RP application on Frontera, they will have to search for the [resource_tacc.json](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/blob/master/src/radical/pilot/configs/resource_tacc.json) file and, inside that file, for the key(s) that start with the name `frontera`. The file `resource_tacc.json` contains the keys `frontera`, `frontera_rtx`, and `frontera_prte`. Each key identifies a specific set of configuration parameters: `frontera` offers a general-purpose set of configuration parameters; `frontera_rtx` enables the use of the `rtx` queue for GPU nodes; and `frontera_prte` enables the use of the PRTE-based launch method to execute the application's tasks. Thus, for Frontera, the value for `resource` will be `tacc.frontera`, `tacc.frontera_rtx` or `tacc.frontera_prte`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing a predefined configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can customize existing platform configuration files by overwriting existing key/value pairs with ones from configuration files, which have the same names, but located in a user space. Default location of user-defined configuration files is `$HOME/.radical/pilot/configs/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ To change the location for user-defined platform configuration files, please, use env variable `RADICAL_CONFIG_USER_DIR`, which will be used instead of env variable `HOME` in the location path above. Make sure that the corresponding path exists, before creating configs there.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two examples of customized configurations are below: (i) in one for `ornl.summit` you change parameter __system_architecture.options__, and (ii) in another for `tacc.frontera` you set a default launch method `MPIEXEC`. With that files, every pilot description using `'resource': 'ornl.summit'` or `'resource': 'tacc.frontera'` would use that new values. Changed parameters are described in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "__resource_ornl.json__\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"summit\": {\n",
    "        \"system_architecture\": {\n",
    "            \"options\": [\"gpumps\", \"gpudefault\"]\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-defined configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can write whole new configuration for an existing or a new platform with arbitrary platform ID. For example, you will create a custom platform configuration entry `resource_tacc.json` locally. That file will be loaded into the RP's [radical.pilot.Session](../apidoc.rst#Sessions) object alongside with other configurations for TACC-related platforms."
