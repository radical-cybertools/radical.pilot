    "# Using Multiple Pilots\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot supports managing multiple pilots during a single run, while workload (bag of computing tasks) will be distributed among all available pilots. [rp.TaskManager](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager) dispatches tasks to pilots according to a scheduling algorithm ([rp.SCHEDULER_ROUND_ROBIN](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager.scheduler), [rp.SCHEDULER_BACKFILLING](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager.scheduler)), which is provided during its initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ RADICAL-Pilot enacts a second scheduling step within each launched pilot: once the Agent takes ownership of tasks, which the [rp.TaskManager](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager) scheduler assigned to it, the Agent Scheduler will place the tasks on the set of resources (CPU cores, GPUs) that the Agent is managing. The Agent Scheduler can be configured via resource configuration files (see the tutorial [RADICAL-Pilot Configuration System](configuration.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Round-Robin Scheduler, RR (`rp.SCHEDULER_ROUND_ROBIN`, __default__) fairly distributes arriving tasks over the set of known pilots, independent of task state, expected workload, pilot state or pilot lifetime. As such, RR is a fairly simplistic, but also a very fast scheduler, which does not impose any additional communication round trips between [rp.TaskManager](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager) and pilot agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backfilling Scheduler, BF (`rp.SCHEDULER_BACKFILLING`) provides a better load balancing, but at the cost of additional communication round trips. It depends on the actual application workload if that load balancing is beneficial or not. It is most beneficial for the large number of pilots and for relatively long-running tasks (e.g., the task runtime is significantly longer than the communication round trip time between [rp.TaskManager](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.TaskManager) and pilot agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It is __not recommended__ to use BF for: (i) a single pilot, and/or (ii) many short-running tasks.\n",
    "   * BF will only dispatch tasks to pilot agents once the pilot agent is in the `rp.PMGR_ACTIVE` state. The tasks will thus get executed even if one of the pilots never reaches that state - the load will be distributed between pilots which become active (`rp.PMGR_ACTIVE`).\n",
    "   * BF will only dispatch as many tasks to the Agent as they can be executed concurrently. No tasks will be waiting in the Agent Scheduler queue. BF will react on task termination events, and will then backfill (!) the Agent with any remaining tasks. The Agent will remain under-utilized during that communication.\n",
