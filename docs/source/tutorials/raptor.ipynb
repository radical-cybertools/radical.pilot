    "# Executing Tasks with RAPTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces you to RAPTOR, a high-throughput RADICAL-Pilot's subsystem that executes **function** tasks and non-MPI executable tasks at scale on [supported HPC platforms](../supported.rst). This tutorial will guide you through the setup and configuration of RAPTOR and through the specification and execution of a variety of task types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ We assume you have already worked through our [getting started](../getting_started.ipynb) and [describing tasks](describing_tasks.ipynb) tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ All examples in this notebook are executed locally on your machine.  You need to have installed MPI before executing these examples. RADICAL-Pilot and RAPTOR support OpenMPI, MPICH, MVAPICH or any other MPI flavor that provides a standards compliant `mpiexec` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Using RAPTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "Use RAPTOR when you want to concurrently execute free/serialized Python functions, Python class methods and shell commands. For example, you want to concurrently execute up to 10^5 machine learning functions across thousands of GPUs and CPUs. RAPTOR supports single, multi-process and MPI Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also use RAPTOR when your application requires non-MPI tasks which execute for less than 5 minutes. You could use RADICAL-Pilot without RAPTOR for that workload but you would incur into high scheduling and launching overheads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAPTOR\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR is a subsystem of RP, thus you have to execute RP in order to use RAPTOR.  RAPTOR launches a configurable number of masters and workers on the resources you acquired via RP. Once up and running, each RAPTOR's master\n",
    "will receive task execution requests from RP. In turn, each master will dispatch those requests to the workers which are optimized to execute small, short-running tasks at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from RP's 'normal' task, RAPTOR can execute a variety of task types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- executables: similar to RP's native task execution, but without MPI support\n",
    "- free Python functions\n",
    "- Python class methods\n",
    "- serialized Python functions\n",
    "- plain Python code\n",
    "- shell commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, all function invocations can make use of MPI by defining multiple ranks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR has a number of advanced capabilities, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- new task types can be added by applications\n",
    "- the RAPTOR Master class can be overloaded by applications\n",
    "- the RAPTOR Worker class can be overloaded by applications\n",
    "- Master and Worker layout can be tuned in a variety of ways\n",
    "- different Worker implementations are available with different capabilities and scaling properties\n",
    "- workload execution can mix RAPTOR task execution and 'normal' RP task execution\n",
    "  \n",
    "Those topics will not be covered in this basic tutorial.\n"
