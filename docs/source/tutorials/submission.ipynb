    "# Using RADICAL-Pilot on HPC Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot consists of a client and a so-called agent. Client and agent can execute on two different machines, e.g., the former on your workstation, the latter on an HPC platform's compute node. Alternatively, the client can execute on the login node of an HPC platform and the agent on a compute node, or both client and agent can execute on a compute node. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to deploy RADICAL-Pilot depends on the platform's policies that regulate access to the platform (ssh, DUO, hardware token), and the amount and type of resources that can be used on a login node (usually minimal). Further, each HPC platform will require a specific resource configuration file (provided with RADICAL-Pilot) and, in some cases, some user-dependent configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "RADICAL-Pilot (RP) provides three ways to use [supported HPC platforms](../supported.rst) to execute workloads:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote submission**: users can execute their RP application from their workstation, and then RP accesses the HPC platform via `ssh`.\n",
    "- **Interactive submission**: users can submit an interactive/batch job on the HPC platform, and then RP from a compute node.\n",
    "- **Login submission**: users can `ssh` into the login node of the HPC platform, and then launch their RP application from that shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote submission\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ Remote submission **does not work with two factors authentication**. Target HPC platforms need to support passphrase-protected ssh keys as a login method without the use of a second authentication factor. Usually, the user needs to reach an agreement with the system administrators of the platform in order to allow `ssh` connections from a specific IP address. Putting such an agreement in place is from difficult to impossible, and requires a fixed IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "__Warning:__ Remote submissions **require a `ssh` connection to be alive for the entire duration of the application**. If the `ssh` connection fails while the application executes, the application will fail. This has the potential of leaving an orphan RP Agent running on the HPC platform, consuming allocation and failing to properly execute any new application task. Remote submissions should not be attempted on a laptop with a Wi-Fi connection; and the risk of interrupting the `ssh` connection increases with the time taken by the application to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can manually `ssh` into the target HPC platform, RADICAL-Pilot can do the same. You will have to set up an ssh key and, for example, follow up this [guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys#how-to-configure-key-based-authentication) if you need to become more familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** RADICAL-Pilot will not work without configuring the `ssh-agent`, and it will require entering the user's ssh key passphrase to access the HPC platform\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use RADICAL-Pilot's API and store ssh-specific information within your application. Remote usernames, passwords, and keyfiles and can be set in a [radical.pilot.Context](../apidoc.rst#radical.pilot.Context) object. For example, if you want to tell RADICAL-Pilot your user-id on the remote resource, you can use the following:"

Following the [user guide](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guide/system/), each Cascade Lake (CLX) Compute Nodes of Frontera has 56 cores. Thus, you will need 74 nodes (you may want to consider whether your application could scale to use all the available 4144 cores).\n",
