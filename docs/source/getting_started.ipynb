    "This notebook walks you through executing a `hello_world` application written with RADICAL-Pilot (RP) and locally executed on a GNU/Linux operating system. The application consists of a Bag of Tasks with heterogeneous requirements: different number of CPU cores/GPUs and different execution time for each task. In this simple application, tasks have no data requirements but see [data staging](tutorials/staging_data.ipynb) for how to manage data in RP.\n",
