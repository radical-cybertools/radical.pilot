Simple Bag-of-Tasks
*******************

You might be wondering how to create your own RADICAL-Pilot script or how
RADICAL-Pilot can be useful for your needs. Before delving into the remote job
and data submission capabilities that RADICAL-Pilot has, its important to
understand the basics. 

The simplest usage of a pilot-job system is to submit multiple identical tasks
(a 'Bag of Tasks' / 'BoT') collectively, i.e. as one big job! Such usage arises 
for example to perform parameter sweep jobs, or to execute ensemble simulation.

We will create an example which submits `N` tasks using RADICAL-Pilot. The tasks are
all identical, except that they each record their number in their output. This
type of run is very useful if you are running many jobs using the same
executable (but perhaps with different input files).  Rather than submit each job
individually to the queuing system and then wait for every job to become active individually, you submit just one container job (called the Pilot). When this pilot becomes active, it executes your tasks on the reserved cores.  RADICAL-Pilot names such 
tasks 'Compute Units', or short 'CUs'.

Preparation
------------

Download the file ``simple_bot.py`` with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot/master/examples/docs/simple_bot.py


Open the file ``simple_bot.py`` with your favorite editor. The example should 
work right out of the box on your local machine. However, if you want to try it
out with different resources, like remote HPC clusters, look for the sections 
marked: 

.. code-block:: python

        # ----- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS -- CHANGE THIS ------

and change the code below accordging to the instructions in the comments.

.. Let's discuss the above example. We define our executable as "/bin/echo," the
.. simple UNIX command that writes arguments to standard output. Next, we need to
.. provide the arguments. In this case, "I am CU number $CU_NO," would correspond
.. to typing ``/bin/echo 'I am task number $CU_NO'`` on command line.  ``$CU_NO``
.. is an environment variable, so we will need to provide a value for it, as is
.. done on the next line: ``{'CU_NO': i}``. Note that this block of code is in
.. a python for loop, therefore, ``i`` corresponds to what iteration we are on.
.. This is not a parallel code, echo uses just one core, so we specify ``cores=1``.

----------
Execution
---------

**This assumes you have installed RADICAL-Pilot either globally or in a 
Python virtualenv. You also need access to a MongoDB server.**

Set the `RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL` environment variable in your shell to the 
MongoDB server you want to use, for example:

.. code-block:: bash
        
        export RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL=mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<mongodb_server>:27017/<database>

If RADICAL-Pilot is installed and the MongoDB URL is set, you should be good
to run your program (the database is created on the fly): 

.. code-block:: bash

    python simple_bot.py

The output should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    Initializing Pilot Manager ...
    Submitting Compute Pilot to Pilot Manager ...
    Initializing Unit Manager ...
    Registering Compute Pilot with Unit Manager ...
    Submit Compute Units to Unit Manager ...
    Waiting for CUs to complete ...
    ...
    Waiting for CUs to complete ...
    All CUs completed!
    Closed session, exiting now ...


----------------------
Logging and Debugging
----------------------

Since working with distributed systems is inherently complex and much of the
complexity is hidden within RADICAL-Pilot, it is necessary to do a lot of
internal logging. By default, logging output is disabled, but if something goes
wrong or if you're just curious, you can enable the logging output by setting
the environment variable ``RADICAL_PILOT_LOG_LVL`` to a value between CRITICAL
(print only critical messages) and DEBUG (print all messages).  For more details
on logging, see under 'Debugging' in chapter :ref:`chapter_developers`.

Give it a try with the above example:

.. code-block:: bash

  RADICAL_PILOT_LOG_LVL=DEBUG python simple_bot.py
