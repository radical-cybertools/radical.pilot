class Component(object):
    """
    This class provides the basic structure for any RP component which operates
    on stateful things.  It provides means to:

      - define input channels on which to receive new things in certain states
      - define work methods which operate on the things to advance their state
      - define output channels to which to send the things after working on them
      - define notification channels over which messages with other components
        can be exchanged (publish/subscriber channels)

    All low level communication is handled by the base class -- deriving classes
    will register the respective channels, valid state transitions, and work
    methods.  When a 'thing' is received, the component is assumed to have full
    ownership over it, and that no other component will change the 'thing's
    state during that time.

    The main event loop of the component -- work_cb() -- is executed as
    a separate process.  Components inheriting this class should be fully self
    sufficient, and should specifically attempt not to use shared resources.
    That will ensure that multiple instances of the component can coexist for
    higher overall system throughput.  Should access to shared resources be
    necessary, it will require some locking mechanism across process boundaries.

    This approach should ensure that

      - 'thing's are always in a well defined state;
      - components are simple and focus on the semantics of 'thing' state
        progression;
      - no state races can occur on 'thing' state progression;
      - only valid state transitions can be enacted (given correct declaration
        of the component's semantics);
      - the overall system is performant and scalable.

    Inheriting classes may overload the methods:

        initialize
        finalize

    These method should be used to

      - set up the component state for operation
      - register input/output/notification channels
      - register work methods
      - register callbacks to be invoked on state notification
      - tear down the same on closing

    Inheriting classes MUST call the constructor:

        class StagingComponent(rpu.Component):
            def __init__(self, cfg, session):
                rpu.Component.__init__(self, cfg, session)

    Further, the class must implement the registered work methods, with
    a signature of:

        work(self, things)

    The method is expected to change the state of the 'thing's given.  'Thing's
    will not be pushed to outgoing channels automatically -- to do so, the work
    method has to call (see call documentation for other options):

        self.advance(thing)

    Until that method is called, the component is considered the sole owner of
    the 'thing's.  After that method is called, the 'thing's are considered
    disowned by the component.  If, however, components return from the work
    methods without calling advance on the given 'thing's, then the component
    keeps ownership of the 'thing's to advance it asynchronously at a later
    point in time.  That implies that a component can collect ownership over an
    arbitrary number of 'thing's over time, and they can be advanced at the
    component's descretion.
