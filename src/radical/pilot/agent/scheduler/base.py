#
# An RP agent scheduler will place incoming units onto a set of cores and gpus.
#
# This is the agent scheduler base class.  It provides the framework for
# implementing diverse scheduling algorithms and mechanisms, tailored toward
# specific workload types, resource configurations, batch systems etc.
#
# The base class provides the following functionality to the implementations:
#
#   - obtain configuration settings from config files and environments
#   - create aself._nodes list to represent available resources;
#   - general control and data flow:
#
#       # main loop
#       self._handle_unit(unit):  # unit arrives
#         try_allocation(unit)    # placement is attempted
#         if success:
#            advance(unit)        # pass unit to executor
#         else:
#            wait.append(unit)    # place unit in a wait list
#
#   - notification management:
#     - the scheduler receives notifications about units which completed
#       execution, and whose resources can now be used again for other units,
#     - the above triggers an 'unschedule' (free resources) action and also a
#       `schedule` action (check waitpool if waiting units can now be placed).
#
#
# A scheduler implementation will derive from this base class, and overload the
# following three methods:
#
#   _configure():
#     - make sure that the base class configuration is usable
#     - do any additional configuration
#
#   _schecule_unit(unit):
#     - given a unit (incl. description), find and return a suitable allocation
#
#   unschedule_unit(unit):
#     - release the allocation held by that unit
#
#
# The scheduler needs (in the general case) three pieces of information:
#
#   - the layout of the resource (nodes, cores, gpus);
#   - the current state of those (what cores/gpus are used by other units)
#   - the requirements of the unit (single/multi node, cores, gpus)
#
# The first part (layout) is provided by the LRMS, in the form of a nodelist:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: 16, gpus : 2},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: 16, gpus : 2},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# That is then mapped into an internal representation, which is really the same
# but allows to keep track of resource usage, by setting the fields to
# `rpc.FREE == '-'` or `rpc.BUSY == '#'`:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: [----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: {----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# When allocating a set of resource for a unit (2 cores, 1 gpu), we can now
# record those as used:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: [##--------------], gpus : [#-]},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: {----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# This solves the second part from our list above.  The third part, unit
# requirements, are obtained from the unit dict passed for scheduling: the unit
# description contains requests for `cores` and `gpus`.
#
# Note that the unit description will also list the number of processes and
# threads for cores and gpus, and also flags the use of `mpi`, 'openmp', etc.
# The scheduler will have to make sure that for each process to be placed, the
# given number of additional cores are available *and reserved* to create
# threads on.  The threads are created by the application.  Note though that
# this implies that the launcher must pin cores very carefully, to not constrain
# the thread creation for the application.
#
# The scheduler algorithm will then attempt to find a suitable set of cores and
# gpus in the nodelist into which the unit can be placed.  It will mark those as
# `rpc.BUSY`, and attach the set of cores/gpus to the unit dictionary, as (here
# for system with 8 cores & 1 gpu per node):
#
#     unit = { ...
#       'cpu_processes'   : 4,
#       'cpu_process_type': 'mpi',
#       'cpu_threads'     : 2,
#       'gpu_processes    : 2,
#       'slots' :
#       {                 # [[node,   node_uid,   [cpu idx],        [gpu idx]]]
#         'nodes'         : [[node_1, node_uid_1, [[0, 2], [4, 6]], [[0]    ]],
#                            [node_2, node_uid_2, [[1, 3], [5, 7]], [[0]    ]]],
#         'cores_per_node': 8,
#         'gpus_per_node' : 1,
#         'lm_info'       : { ... }
#       }
#     }
#
# The `cpu idx` field is a list of sets, where in each set the first core is
# where an application process is places, while the other cores are reserved for
# that process' threads.  For GPUs we use the same structure, but GPU processes
# are currently all considered to be single-threaded.
#
# The respective launch method is expected to create processes on the set of
# cpus and gpus thus specified, (node_1, cores 0 and 4; node_2, cores 1 and 5).
# The other reserved cores are for the application to spawn threads on
# (`cpu_threads=2`).
#
# A scheduler MAY attach other information to the `slots` structure, with the
# intent to support the launch methods to enact the placement decition made by
# the scheduler.  In fact, a scheduler may use a completely different slot
# structure than above - but then is likely bound to a specific launch method
# which can interpret that structure.  A notable example is the BG/Q torus
# scheduler which will only work in combination with the dplace launch methods.
# `lm_info` is an opaque field which allows to communicate specific settings
# from the lrms to the launch method.
#
# FIXME: `lm_info` should be communicated to the LM instances in creation, not
#        as part of the slots.  Its constant anyway, as lm_info is set only
#        once during lrms startup.
#
# NOTE:  While the nodelist resources are listed as strings above, we in fact
#        use a list of integers, to simplify some operations, and to
#        specifically avoid string copies on manipulations.  We only convert
#        to a stringlist for visual representation (`self.slot_status()`).
#
# NOTE:  The scheduler will allocate one core per node and GPU, as some startup
#        methods only allow process placements to *cores*, even if GPUs are
#        present and requested (hi aprun).  We should make this decision
#        dependent on the `lm_info` field - but at this point we don't have this
#        information (at least not readily available).
#
# TODO:  use named tuples for the slot structure to make the code more readable,
#        specifically for the LMs.
#
# NOTE:  The set of profiler events generated by this component are:
#
#        schedule_try    : search for unit resources starts    (uid: uid)
#        schedule_fail   : search for unit resources failed    (uid: uid)
