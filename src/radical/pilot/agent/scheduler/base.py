#
# An RP agent scheduler will place incoming tasks onto a set of cores and gpus.
#
# This is the agent scheduler base class.  It provides the framework for
# implementing diverse scheduling algorithms and mechanisms, tailored toward
# specific workload types, resource configurations, batch systems etc.
#
# The base class provides the following functionality to the implementations:
#
#   - obtain configuration settings from config files and environments
#   - create aself._nodes list to represent available resources;
#   - general control and data flow:
#
#       # main loop
#       self._handle_task(task):  # task arrives
#         try_allocation(task)    # placement is attempted
#         if success:
#            advance(task)        # pass task to executor
#         else:
#            wait.append(task)    # place task in a wait list
#
#   - notification management:
#     - the scheduler receives notifications about tasks which completed
#       execution, and whose resources can now be used again for other tasks,
#     - the above triggers an 'unschedule' (free resources) action and also a
#       `schedule` action (check waitpool if waiting tasks can now be placed).
#
#
# A scheduler implementation will derive from this base class, and overload the
# following three methods:
#
#   _configure():
#     - make sure that the base class configuration is usable
#     - do any additional configuration
#
#   _schecule_task(task):
#     - given a task (incl. description), find and return a suitable allocation
#
#   unschedule_task(task):
#     - release the allocation held by that task
#
#
# The scheduler needs (in the general case) three pieces of information:
#
#   - the layout of the resource (nodes, cores, gpus);
#   - the current state of those (what cores/gpus are used by other tasks)
#   - the requirements of the task (single/multi node, cores, gpus)
#
# The first part (layout) is provided by the ResourceManager, in the form of a nodelist:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: 16, gpus : 2},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: 16, gpus : 2},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# That is then mapped into an internal representation, which is really the same
# but allows to keep track of resource usage, by setting the fields to
# `rpc.FREE == '-'` or `rpc.BUSY == '#'`:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: [----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: {----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# When allocating a set of resource for a task (2 cores, 1 gpu), we can now
# record those as used:
#
#    nodelist = [{name : 'node_1', cores: [##--------------], gpus : [#-]},
#                {name : 'node_2', cores: {----------------], gpus : [--]},
#                ...
#               ]
#
# This solves the second part from our list above.  The third part, task
# requirements, are obtained from the task dict passed for scheduling: the task
# description contains requests for `cores` and `gpus`.
#
# Note that the task description will also list the number of processes and
# threads for cores and gpus, and also flags the use of `mpi`, 'openmp', etc.
# The scheduler will have to make sure that for each process to be placed, the
# given number of additional cores are available *and reserved* to create
# threads on.  The threads are created by the application.  Note though that
# this implies that the launcher must pin cores very carefully, to not constrain
# the thread creation for the application.
#
# The scheduler algorithm will then attempt to find a suitable set of cores and
# gpus in the nodelist into which the task can be placed.  It will mark those as
# `rpc.BUSY`, and attach the set of cores/gpus to the task dictionary, as (here
# for system with 8 cores & 1 gpu per node):
#
#     task = { ...
#       'cpu_processes'   : 4,
#       'cpu_process_type': 'mpi',
#       'cpu_threads'     : 2,
#       'gpu_processes    : 2,
#       'slots' :
#       {                 # [[node,   node_uid,   [cpu idx],        [gpu idx]]]
#         'nodes'         : [[node_1, node_uid_1, [[0, 2], [4, 6]], [[0]    ]],
#                            [node_2, node_uid_2, [[1, 3], [5, 7]], [[0]    ]]],
#         'cores_per_node': 8,
#         'gpus_per_node' : 1,
#         'lm_info'       : { ... }
#       }
#     }
#
# The `cpu idx` field is a list of sets, where in each set the first core is
# where an application process is places, while the other cores are reserved for
# that process' threads.  For GPUs we use the same structure, but GPU processes
# are currently all considered to be single-threaded.
#
# The respective launch method is expected to create processes on the set of
# cpus and gpus thus specified, (node_1, cores 0 and 4; node_2, cores 1 and 5).
# The other reserved cores are for the application to spawn threads on
# (`cpu_threads=2`).
#
# A scheduler MAY attach other information to the `slots` structure, with the
# intent to support the launch methods to enact the placement decition made by
# the scheduler.  In fact, a scheduler may use a completely different slot
# structure than above - but then is likely bound to a specific launch method
# which can interpret that structure.  A notable example is the BG/Q torus
# scheduler which will only work in combination with the dplace launch methods.
# `lm_info` is an opaque field which allows to communicate specific settings
# from the rm to the launch method.
#
# FIXME: `lm_info` should be communicated to the LM instances in creation, not
#        as part of the slots.  Its constant anyway, as lm_info is set only
#        once during rm startup.
#
# NOTE:  While the nodelist resources are listed as strings above, we in fact
#        use a list of integers, to simplify some operations, and to
#        specifically avoid string copies on manipulations.  We only convert
#        to a stringlist for visual representation (`self.slot_status()`).
#
# NOTE:  The scheduler will allocate one core per node and GPU, as some startup
#        methods only allow process placements to *cores*, even if GPUs are
#        present and requested (hi aprun).  We should make this decision
#        dependent on the `lm_info` field - but at this point we don't have this
#        information (at least not readily available).
#
# TODO:  use named tuples for the slot structure to make the code more readable,
#        specifically for the LaunchMethods.
#
# NOTE:  The set of profiler events generated by this component are:
#
#        schedule_try    : search for task resources starts    (uid: uid)
#        schedule_fail   : search for task resources failed    (uid: uid)
#        schedule_ok     : search for task resources succeeded (uid: uid)

        # FIXME: The specification for `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is actually Launch
        #        Method dependent.  Assume the scheduler assigns the second GPU.
        #        Manually, one would set `CVD=1`.  That also holds for launch
        #        methods like `fork` which leave GPU indexes unaltered.  Other
        #        launch methods like `jsrun` mask the system GPUs and only the
        #        second GPU is visible to the task.  To CUDA the system now
        #        seems to have only one GPU, and we need set it to `CVD=0`.
        #
        #        In other words, CVD sometimes needs to be set to the physical
        #        GPU IDs, and at other times to the logical GPU IDs (IDs as
        #        visible to the task).  This also implies that this code should
        #        actually live within the launch method.  On the upside, the
        #        Launch Method should also be able to handle heterogeneus tasks.

        Scheduling, in very general terms, maps resource request to available

        order to estimate the resource requirements of the tast, we assume that
        the most basic attributes (cores, threads, GPUs, MPI/non-MPI) determine
        the resulting placement decision.  Specifically, we assume that this
        tuple of attributes result in a placement that is valid for all tasks

        To speed up that tuple lookup and to simplify some scheduler
