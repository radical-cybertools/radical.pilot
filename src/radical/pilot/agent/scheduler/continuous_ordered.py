# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a simple extension of the Continuous scheduler which evaluates the
# `order` tag of arriving tasks, which is expected to have the form
#
#   order : {'ns'   : <string>,
#            'order': <int>,
#            'size' : <int>}
#
# where 'ns' is a namespace, 'order' is an integer defining the order of bag of
# tasks in that namespace, and 'size' is the number of tasks in that bag.  The
# semantics of the scheduler is that, for any given namespace, a BoT with order
# 'n' will only be executed after 'size' tasks of the BoT with order 'n-1' have
# been executed.  The first BoT is expected to have order '0'.
#
# The dominant use case for this scheduler is the execution of pipeline stages,
# where one stage needs to be completed before tasks from the next stage can be
# considered for scheduling.
#
# FIXME: - failed tasks cannot yet be recognized
