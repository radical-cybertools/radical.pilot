class LRMS(object):
    """
    The Local Resource Manager (LRMS -- where does the 's' come from, actually?)
    provide three fundamental information:

      LRMS.node_list      : a list of node names
      LRMS.agent_node_list: the list of nodes reserved for agent execution
      LRMS.cores_per_node : the number of cores each node has available

    Schedulers can rely on these information to be available.  Specific LRMS
    incarnation may have additional information available -- but schedulers
    relying on those are invariably bound to the specific LRMS.  An example is
    the Torus Scheduler which relies on detailed torus layout information from
    the LoadLevelerLRMS (which describes the BG/Q).

    The LRMS will reserve nodes for the agent execution, by deriving the
    respectively required node count from the config's 'agents' section.
    Those nodes will be listed in LRMS.agent_node_list. Schedulers MUST NOT use
    the agent_node_list to place compute units -- CUs are limited to the nodes
    in LRMS.node_list.
    """

    # TODO: Core counts dont have to be the same number for all hosts.

    # TODO: We might not have reserved the whole node.

    # TODO: Given that the Agent can determine the real core count, in
    #       principle we could just ignore the config and use as many as we
    #       have to our availability (taken into account that we might not
    #       have the full node reserved of course)
    #       Answer: at least on Yellowstone this doesnt work for MPI,
    #               as you can't spawn more tasks then the number of slots.
